# cripples-bastards-and-broken-things

On this project we will fix broken code, do not change anything in the test files just in the regular js files.
### Basic Setup

1. Clone this repo. 
2. Go into the repo and run `npm i` to install the `jest` testing framework.
3. Run `npm test` in a terminal, preferably a full-screened one for a proper display of your test results. Or, alternately, use an in-line test runner if you have one.
